You need to clone project

https://github.com/reiern70/highcharts-serverside-export

locally and do mvn clean install.

There is a Start.class you can use to launch a jetty server on :8080.

Juts point your browser to

http://localhost:8080/html (for HTML)

and to

http://localhost:8080/report (for PDF)
